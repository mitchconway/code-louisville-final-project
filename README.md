For my final project I wanted to imagine filling the craters of the moon with food items and determining how many calories were in each crater.  I just thought it was interesting.  First I found two data sources from Kaggle.  One that contained data about the internal volume of the moon craters, and another that contained data about caloric values of food.  I realized that my files contained a lot of data so then I decided to just use the top ten volume from the crater file and the top ten calorie values from the food file.  I was able to graph the top ten from each file to visualize them.  In a later course, if I were to continue this project, I would add visualizations for the calorie value of the craters, but I feel like that is more advanced than where I am at currently.
#Feature 1
Write markdown cells in Jupyter explaining your thought process and code. If you make a few plots with matplotlib, explain what the reader is seeing and why you chose to plot things that way.
# FEATURE 2
Read in data from a local csv, excel file, json, or any other file type.
# Feature 3
Created a new data frame and csv from a previous one to remove values where they don’t belong in your dataset.
#Feature 4
Many to many relationship
Write custom functions to operate on your data. You may discover that you want tofind out something particular about data that just doesn’t have a built-in Pandas function that accomplishes your goal. Maybe you want your function to read in a DataFrame, search the columns for any mention of “Cars”, then return the lowest-priced car in the column along with the mileage. This category is very open to interpretation, so any function operating on your data will work.
